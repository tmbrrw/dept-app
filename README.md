# DEPT Agency Tech Test

## Details

A web-based application used to compare air quality indexes of selected UK cities.

The app uses the Open Air Quality API to serve data relating to specific locations (more info at https://docs.openaq.org)


## Tech

This application has been developed using React JS and SASS/CSS


## Running the application

`npm run build`
Creates an optimised production build of the application which can then be served locally using `serve -s build` (or by configuring a local server application such as MAMP/XAMP).


`npm start`
Initates development mode of the application and serve locally via port 3000 by default. 


## Notes
Creative decisions have been made during development to enhance the usability of the application. For this reason, some UI elements may not fully reflect the designs in an attempt to demonstrate initiative during the front-end development process.

Certain elements have been implemented as a proof of concept and may not necessarily reflect the data in real-world conditions (e.g. colour-coded air quality measurements used to illustrate improved legibility).

The functionality of the application remains true to the original brief.
